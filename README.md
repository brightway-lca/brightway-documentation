## ‚òëÔ∏è Instructions

1. Clone this repository (use `git clone --recursive`, because the repository has submodules. See below).
2. Set up a Python virtual environment that includes all packages required to build the documentation. A [Conda `yaml` file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) is provided [for convenient setup](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) at [``setup/conda_environment.yml``](setup/conda_environment.yml). Install the environment by running from the repository root directory:

```
conda env create -f 'setup/conda_environment.yml'
```

and activate the environment:

```
conda activate sphinx
```
3. [Build the documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) (manually). To trigger the build manually, run [`sphinx-build`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html) from the repository root directory:

```
sphinx-build sphinx _build/html -b singlehtml -a
```

| positional argument or option| value | description |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| sourcedir | `./sphinx` | N/A |
| outdir | `./_build/html` | N/A |
| -b | `singlehtml` | create only a single html page |
| -a | N/A | always write all output files |

and preview the documentation by opening:

```
_build/html/index.html
```

4. [Build the documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) (automatically): For automatic builds, providing a live preview of changes, run [`sphinx-autobuild`](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild) from the repository root directory:

```
sphinx-autobuild sphinx _build/html -a
```

| positional argument or option| value | description |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| sourcedir | `./sphinx` | N/A |
| outdir | `./_build/html` | N/A |
| -a | N/A | always write all output files |


This will start watching all changes in the `./sphinx` directory and provide a live html preview of the Sphinx documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

5. Push changes to the documentation website `documentation.brightway.dev`. The site is based on `readthedocs.org`, which triggers it own builds of the documentation. A new build is triggered with every merge into the `master` branch of this repository.

## üìÅ `git` submodules

### clonning

If you are **clonning for the first time the repository**, clone it with:

```
# for ssh based clonning
git clone --recursive git@github.com:brightway-lca/brightway-documentation.git
```
or
```
# for https based clonning
git clone --recursive https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway-documentation.git
```
If you already have a working copy of the repository, update your copy with:

```
git submodule update --init
```
### updating

If you have set up the submodules, you can update the repository with pull like you would normally do.
**To pull everything including the submodules**, add `--recurse-submodules` to `git pull`

```
# pull the changes in the brightway documentation repo and changes in the submodules
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

**To pull the changes in the submodules only**, use:
```
# pull the changes in the submodules
git submodule update --remote
```
