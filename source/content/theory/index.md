# Theory

This section contains long-form descriptions of the theory behind life cycle assessment and the Brightway software framework.
This could be _"how does Brightway store data on life-cycle inventory objects"_, or _"how does graph traversal work"_.
The examples are organized by topic, with cross-references to the relevant sections of the documentation or to specific Brightway functions.

```{note}
If you have questions that the documentation cannot answer, you can [get in touch with the Brightway community or the Brightway developers](../contact/contact.md).
