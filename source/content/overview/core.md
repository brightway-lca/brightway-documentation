# Brightway core libraries

The four core libraries in Brightway are:

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [`bw2data`](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-data) | Project management, graph storage and ORM using SQLite, search |
| [`bw2calc`](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-calc) | Matrix-based calculations |
| [`bw2io`](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-io) | [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) for LCA data |
| [`bw2analyzer`](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-analyzer) | Analyze inventory data and LCA results |

These core libraries in turn are built on the following support libraries:
