# Getting Started

```{note}
This version of the documentation is for older releases of Brightway (`legacy` or `brightway2`). You can access [the complete **Getting Started** pages by switching to the latest version](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/content/gettingstarted/index.html). While many of the concepts and methods are the same, the latest version of Brightway has many new features and improvements.
